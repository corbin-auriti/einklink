    <p>E-ink is the technology that power e-readers like the Amazon Kindle and Kobo devices. It's what enables them to be have extremely low power consumption while helping prevent eyestrain.</p>
    <p>There is evidence that using smartphones in the bedroom leads to insomnia. But sometimes, when in bed, we also want to know about the world around us: what's the weather going to be tomorrow? what's going on in the news?</p>  
    <p>This is where the basic built-in web browser that come with most e-readers can be so useful. However, as the average website becomes more complex and bloated sometimes they don't look so great on such a basic web browser.</p>
    <p>Enter eink.link, a really simple website to share links to useful resources that load quickly and look good on very basic web browsers such as those that come with e-readers! This site is maintained by <a href="https://dougbelshaw.com">Doug Belshaw</a> as a side project. You are encouraged to submit websites via the link in the footer.</p>
