      <h2>About</h2>

    <p>The basic built-in web browser that comes with most e-readers can be useful for finding useful information while preventing eyestrain.</p>     
    <p>However, as the average website becomes ever-more complex and bloated, they often don't look so great on such a basic web browser. Sometimes they don't load at all.</p>
      <p>Enter <strong>eink.link</strong>, a really simple website to share links to useful resources that load quickly and look good on very basic web browsers such as those that come with e-readers! This site is a project to which anyone may contribute - please submit websites via the link in the footer.</p>
